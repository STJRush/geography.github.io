<h2> Why is Geography practical? </h2>
<h3><li>Your read non-fictional books. All the books you read will have true concrete facts, nothing is made up. All the facts will contribute to your knowledge in an exam situation.</li>
<li> You develop spatial awareness. Studying geography develops better spatial awareness. It is important to learn map sense and globe-reading skills yet these activities are virtually gone from education today. Could your students point north if you asked them? Could they look at a map and identify the location of our continents and oceans without the help of technology? Would your students know how to find their way home or to the next county without a GPS?</li>
