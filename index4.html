<h1 style="color:darkblue;"> Meet a Geography Teacher</h1>

<h3><li>Question 1- Why did you want to teach Geography?</h3></li>
    
<h3> I found it easy when I was in school. I enjoyed the structure of the course. You are either right or wrong no in between. It's also a very nice contrast to my other subject, which is English.</h3>
    
<h3><li>Question 2- Why should students choose it?</h3></li>
    
<h3>They should choose it because it teaches us about the world we live in, Geography is useful inside and outside of school.</h3>

<h3><li>Question 3- Is the information students learn useful?</h3></li>

<h3>Of course, yes! You will learn about different places in the world that you have never learnt about and how the world works. You will also learn about Ireland in relation to the rest of the world, which is very important!</h3>

<h3><li>Question 4- Any tips for a students who may want to go on to study geography in college?</h3></li>

<h3>Geography only gets more interesting! There is such a broad choice of Modules you can study in college. I had to do a project on Ardgillen castle, I had to explain how the use of it has changed... 500 years ago it was a house now it gets lots of visitors and is mainly used for sightseeing and going to the cafe.</h3>
